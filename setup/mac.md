# Mac OSX Installation Guide

This document will guide you through setup on Mac OSX so you'll be ready to do the course exercises, and optionally, continue exploring Scala after you're done.

## Part 1: prerequisites for course exercises

### Check your Java installation
Open Spotlight by clicking the magnifying glass icon on the upper right corner of your screen

Type `terminal` in the search box

Click the Terminal application entry to launch your terminal session:

![Terminal in Spotlight](https://res.cloudinary.com/rafa-paradela/image/upload/v1536968531/terminal_spotlight.jpg)

You will see a window that looks like this:

![Terminal Window](https://res.cloudinary.com/rafa-paradela/image/upload/v1536968531/terminal_window.jpg)

You'll use this terminal window to complete the rest of this installation guide.

### Install Java
Recent versions of Mac OS come with Java already installed.  Confirm that your computer has Java installed by typing:
```
java -version
```
at the command prompt in your terminal window. You should see a response similar to:
```
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_20"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_20-b26)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.20-b23, mixed mode)
```
_Note: the `$` represents the command prompt. It may look different in your terminal._

You need Java version 1.8 or higher in order to run Scala 2.12. If the version of Java installed on your computer is older than 1.8, use your Mac's Software Update utility to upgrade to the current version before continuing.

### Install Doodle

[Download the ZIP file here](https://github.com/underscoreio/creative-scala-template/archive/master.zip). Unzip the project and navigate inside the unzipped directory (called `creative-scala-template`) from the terminal. Make sure you can do the following (this will take a little while the first time you do it).

```
$ ./sbt.sh
.
.
. (you'll see some [info] logs here)
.
.
> console
.
.
. (you'll see some [info] logs here)
.
.
scala> Example.image.draw()
```

An image of three circles should appear!

## Part 2: optional Scala and SBT install for further learning

If you wish to go beyond using doodle and create projects of your own, or just play around in the REPL, you will want to have Scala and SBT installed. This section walks you through how to do this.

### Install Homebrew
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a software package manager for Mac OS. To install Homebrew, paste the following line at your terminal prompt:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

and follow the instructions in the installation script.

You will see output like this in your terminal:

```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
==> This script will install:
/usr/local/bin/brew
/usr/local/Library/...
/usr/local/share/doc/homebrew
/usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1
...
/usr/local/share/man
/usr/local/share/man/man1

Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort
...
==> Installation successful!
==> Next steps
Run `brew help` to get started
Further documentation: https://git.io/brew-docs
==> Homebrew has enabled anonymous aggregate user behaviour analytics
Read the analytics documentation (and how to opt-out) here:
  https://git.io/brew-analytics
```

Verify that Homebrew is installed by typing
```
brew help
```

```
$ brew help
Example usage:
  brew search [TEXT|/REGEX/]
  brew (info|home|options) [FORMULA...]
  brew install FORMULA...
  brew update
  brew upgrade [FORMULA...]
  brew uninstall FORMULA...
  brew list [FORMULA...]
...
```

### Install Scala

Now that you have brew installed, you can get the latest version of scala very easily:

```
brew install scala
```

Now you should be able access the Scala REPL:

```
$ scala
cat: /release: No such file or directory
Welcome to Scala 2.12.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_20).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala>
```
(_note: ignore the warning `cat: /release: No such file or directory`_)

Type
```
:help
```
at the `scala>` prompt to see instructions for using the REPL.

```
scala> :help
All commands can be abbreviated, e.g., :he instead of :help.
:edit <id>|<line>        edit history
:help [command]          print this summary or command-specific help
:history [num]           show the history (optional num is commands to show)
:h? <string>             search the history
...
```

Type
```
:quit
```
at the `scala>` prompt to exit the REPL and return to the terminal prompt.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Scala.

### Install SBT

To install sbt, use brew once again:

```
brew install sbt
```

To check the installation, run `sbt` and you will see output that looks something like this:

```
$ sbt
[info] Set current project to directory (in build file:/path/to/current/directory/)
>
```
