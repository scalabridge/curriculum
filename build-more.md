# Let's Build Something!

Did you make it through all of [Creative Scala?](http://scalabridge.org/creative-scala.html) Great job! Your path to Scala knowledge is only getting started.   

Here are some ideas of other things you can build to expand on what you just learned:

* Use Doodle to build a hangman style game (hint: you can play by [accepting user input](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.0/scala/io/StdIn$.html))
* Create a [Markov Chain Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)
  * Grab source material from Twitter, Wikipedia, [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
* Parse a [Twitter stream](http://alvinalexander.com/scala/scala-twitter-client-twitter-api-example) to find interesting trends in the data
* Build a [Slack bot](https://api.slack.com/bot-users)
